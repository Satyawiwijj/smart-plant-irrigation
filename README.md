# Smart Plant Irrigation System ðŸŒ±

A simple smart irrigation system that automates watering based on the plant type and local environmental conditions.

## ðŸ’¡ Features
- Choose plant type (e.g., Cactus, Tomato, Tulsi)
- Adjust water threshold based on plant type
- Simulated soil moisture readings
- Alerts when irrigation is needed
- Modular and extensible code

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python
- Tkinter for GUI
- Simulated sensor data (can be upgraded to real sensors using Raspberry Pi or Arduino)

## ðŸ”§ How it Works
1. User selects the plant type.
2. System sets a threshold for moisture level.
3. Simulated sensor values are generated.
4. If moisture < threshold â†’ water the plant (simulated).
